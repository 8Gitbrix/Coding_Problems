<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>You'll write plenty of code this semester, but before you get to it you first
need to learn how to edit and submit your work. We'll cover those steps here.</p>
<p>To keep this writeup short we'll do lots of interactive demonstrations, but the
critical steps and commands will be  documented for future reference.</p>
<h2>fourier.cs.iit.edu</h2>
<p>The CS department Linux course server --- fourier.cs.iit.edu --- has been set up
to provide you with a consistent environment on which to to write, test, and
submit your work. You can certainly work on machine problems on your own
computer if you have Python and Git (the version control system we'll be using)
installed, but for this writeup we'll assume you're logged into fourier.</p>
<p>After obtaining your login information (your username is typically the same as
the one you use for MyIIT, and your password is set to your CWID), you'll log in
to fourier with an SSH client. At the terminal, you can do this with the
command:</p>
<pre><code>ssh username@fourier.cs.iit.edu
</code></pre>
<p>On Windows you may need to start up a separate SSH client such as <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">PuTTY</a> if you don't
have a command line client. Please ask a TA for help if you need it.</p>
<p>After logging in, resist the overwhelming urge to immediately start being
productive! Repeat after me: TERMINAL MULTIPLEXERS ARE AWESOME. You'll learn
about them next.</p>
<h2>tmux</h2>
<p>MPs require multiple coding, testing, and debugging sessions to complete, which
require multiple corresponding login sessions on fourier. Each time you login,
you'll have to navigate into the appropriate work directory, re-open source
file(s) in editors, start up debugging sessions, run tests to obtain output,
etc. All before you can even <em>think</em> about getting work done.</p>
<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>All the above constitute annoying <em>cognitive overhead</em>, and we can all use less
of that (especially given how difficult it is for most students to allocate time
to sit down and work on coursework in the first place).</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be great if you could set things up --- your editing windows,
debuggers, output position --- <em>just the way you like it</em>, <strong><em>one time</em></strong>, then
have it remain that way each time you log back in? Heck yeah. That's where
terminal multiplexers fit in.</p>
<p>Technically, a terminal multiplexer is a program that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Allows you to create and manage multiple terminal sessions from a single
   screen. You can run a different program in each session (e.g., editor,
   debugger, shell).</li>
<li>Continues to run after you log out, so when you reconnect you can simply pick
   up where you left off.</li>
</ol>
<p>Less technically, a terminal multiplexer = bliss.</p>
<p>To start tmux, just use the command <code>tmux</code>. I'll walk you through a few demo
sessions, but the important keys are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>C-b</code>: default prefix key (prefixes all following command keys)</li>
<li><code>c</code>: create a new window</li>
<li><code>n</code>/<code>p</code>: change to the next/previous window</li>
<li><code>"</code>: split the current window</li>
<li><code>&lt;space&gt;</code>: arrange the panes in the current window according to some preset</li>
<li><code>o</code>: change to the next pane in the current window</li>
<li><code>!</code>: break the current pane out of the current window</li>
<li><code>?</code>: list all key bindings</li>
<li><code>d</code>: detach from tmux</li>
</ul>
<p>After detaching from a session, the following command will re-attach you to it
(given that you only have one tmux session running):</p>
<pre><code>tmux at
</code></pre>
<p>You should <strong>NOT</strong> create a new tmux session (with the command <code>tmux</code>) each time you
log in. Instead, you need only do this once --- on subsequent logins you will
simply reattach to your existing session with <code>tmux at</code>.</p>
<p>So... Logged in: check. tmux session attached: check. Moving on.</p>
<h2>Git / Bitbucket</h2>
<p><a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is a <a href="http://betterexplained.com/articles/intro-to-distributed-version-control-illustrated/">distributed version control system</a>, and
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a> is a free Git repository hosting service. You'll use the first to
manage all your code and the second to share it with me.</p>
<p>Here are the steps for setting things up --- we'll walk you through them
interactively. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Clone the private repository (which is owned by the instructor) --- you
   must've accepted an e-mail invitation from the instructor <em>and</em> connected the
   repository to either a pre-exising or new account on Bitbucket for this to
   work:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://bitbucket.org/michaelee/cs331-fall2015-username.git
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set your "upstream" repository to the official public course repository (also
   owned by the instructor's account). This makes it so you can grab updates
   from the official repository in the future.</p>
<pre><code>cd cs331-fall2015-username
git remote add upstream https://bitbucket.org/michaelee/cs331.git
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fetch the initial contents of the public repository, merge them into your
   local branch, then push them to your private repository:</p>
<pre><code>git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
git push origin master
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you can make changes to files within your local repository and commit
them. Add your information to the "README.md" file (you can scan ahead to the
section on editors if you need some help choosing a suitable text editor), then
run this command:</p>
<pre><code>git commit -am "Adding information to README"
</code></pre>
<p>Now push your commit to the private repository on Bitbucket:</p>
<pre><code>git push origin master
</code></pre>
<p>This previous step is effectively how you "submit" your work, as I will be
pulling from this private shared repository after the submission deadline to get
your changes. <strong>If you don't <code>push</code>, I won't see (and can't grade) your work!</strong></p>
<p>That said, you don't need to <code>push</code> after each <code>commit</code>. I recommend you <code>commit</code>
frequently while coding --- a <code>push</code> will send <em>all commits</em> you've made to the
remote repository.</p>
<p>Finally: before starting each machine problem, you should make sure all your
local changes are commited, then fetch and merge any additions to the public
course repository with <code>git fetch upstream; git merge upstream/master</code>. We'll
remind you to do this in each machine problem writeup.</p>
<h2>On editors</h2>
<p>A good programmer has strong opinions about programming languages, coding
conventions, and text editors. There are only two UNIX text editors worth
learning, and learning well: <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> and <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>. Both are installed on
fourier. <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?EmacsVsVi">Pick one</a> and learn a new feature every day.</p>
<p>If you can't be bothered investing time and energy into a tool that you'll use
more than any other and will save you countless keystrokes and hours, then use
the <a href="http://www.nano-editor.org/">nano editor</a> instead. It's also on fourier. I don't recommend it.</p>
<h2>Running Python Scripts</h2>
<p>For the rest of this machine problem you'll work in the "<code>mps/01</code>" subdirectory
of your repository. In there, you'll find the file "hello.py", which contains a
simple Python program.</p>
<p>You can run the program with the following command:</p>
<pre><code>python3 hello.py
</code></pre>
<p>Note the use of <code>python3</code> (and not <code>python</code>) as the command for invoking the interpreter!
(The <code>python</code> command runs version 2 of the interpreter, which is not what we
want --- you can try it and note the error output.)</p>
<h2>A Splash of Code</h2>
<p>For this machine problem we ask that you edit the "hello.py" script and add code
so that:</p>
<ol>
<li>The user is prompted to enter two additional pieces of information (e.g.,
   where they are from, favorite color), which are stored in variables</li>
<li>The output of the script --- displayed after all input is complete ---
   incorporates this information in some meaningful way (e.g., in a lengthier
   "welcome" message).</li>
</ol>
<p>Run and test your program to make sure it works. When done, commit your work
with an appropriate commit message, and push your changes to BitBucket.</p>
<h2>Finishing up</h2>
<p>To earn the points for this machine problem, you must have <strong>pushed your
(working) changes to the "README.md" and "hello.py" files to your private
repository on Bitbucket</strong>. This is also a prerequisite for working on all
subsequent machine problems, so please make sure you know how to do this!</p>
<p>And the big procedural takeaways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Before starting a machine problem, <code>(git fetch upstream ; git merge
   upstream/master)</code></li>
<li>Commit often, and to submit, <code>git push origin master</code></li>
<li><code>python3 FILENAME</code> to run the interpreter on the named Python script.</li>
</ol>
